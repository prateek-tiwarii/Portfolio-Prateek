## Why?

**You may ask why I am writing this blog.**  
**What is my expertise?**  
**What is the purpose of this blog?**

## Introduction

I have been working as a frontend developer for the past 2 years and have learned a lot along the way.

I have seen many developers struggling with frontend development and design principles.

So, I thought: why not share my knowledge with all of you?

In this blog, I will share some key principles that every frontend developer should know. So, let's get started.

First of all, pardon me if I make any mistakes in this blog. I am not a native English speaker and I am an amateur blogger.

## Rule 1 : Needs over design

Don't be like a typical developer

opens vs code

```bash
# Open integrated terminal in VS Code
ctrl + shift + ~

# Create a new Next.js project
npm create-next-app@latest

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

and quickly removes the template code

and now you are **staring** at white screen figuring out if i need a top navbar
or sidebar or a on left or right

what should be the color etc.....

**STOP**  
**STOP**  
**STOP**

Before doing all this take a step back and think about the **needs** of the user
what is the project is about

First of all take a copy and pen | or open notion, obsidian or any note taking app and write down the needs of the user

- what is the project about
- what is the main goal of the project
- what is the target audience
- what is the main feature of the project
- what is the main problem that the project is solving

### Example :

You're building a flight booking service. You could start
with a feature like "**searching for a flight**"

Your interface will need:

- A field for the departure city
- A field for the destination city
- A field for the departure date
- A field for the return date
- A button to perform the search

Now just google out designs for flight booking service and you will get a lot of designs

something like these

all these designs you will find are good but do you really need all these features in your project think about it as well.

remember focus on needs not design

User experience matters _(which includes design as well but only 30% of it)_

## Rule 2 : Improve Incrementally

In early stage of design / development don't try to make everything perfect

don't think about -

- Typefaces to use
- Color schemes
- Animations
- Icons etc

_That stuff will all matter eventually, but it doesn't matter right now._

Focus on creating a **functional** and **usable** product first.

Once you have a **functional** product, you can start **iterating** on it.

You can start by:

- Improving the design
- Adding animations
- Adding icons
- Adding more features

## Rule 3 : Hierarchy is everything

Even if you have colors in your mind. don't just start applying them randomly

first make a Grey scale design
this will force you to focus on the **hierarchy** of the design

like

- Padding
- Margins
- Font sizes
- Font weights
- Line heights etc

It's a little more challenging, but you'll end up with a clearer interface with a strong hierarchy that's easy to enhance with color later.

### GRAYSCALE DESIGN

### COLORFUL DESIGN

also a small tip

> Don't over-invest & overdo things make a clutter free to the point design

## Rule 4 : Don't design too much

You don't need to design every single feature in an app before you move on to implementation, in fact, it's better if you don't.

Figuring out how every feature in a product should interact and how every
edge case should look is really hard, especially in the abstract.

How to handle unknown long errors in the form.  
How will this table look if it has 2000 users.  
What if this same date has 2 events how it will show it.

You're setting yourself up for frustration by trying to figure this stuff out
using only a design tool and your imagination

##### Instead work in cycles

Instead of designing everything upfront on paper or Figma, work in short cycles.

Design a simple version and iterate over it.

Once satisfied with the basic design, implement it.

You'll likely encounter unexpected complexities, but it's easier to fix design problems in a real interface than to imagine every edge case in advance. Iterate on the working design until there are no more issues, then move on to the next feature.

Don't get overwhelmed by abstract planning. Build the real thing as early as possible to reduce the burden on your imagination.
